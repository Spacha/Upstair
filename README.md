# Upstair
Health monitoring system for Texas Instruments Real Time Operating System (TI-RTOS).

## Relevant files
- `main.c`
- `Upstair.h`
- Everything under `bitmaps/`
- Everything under `libs/`

In addition, I made some changes to some files under `wireless`. The device had to be able to communicate with other similar devices (send & receive messages).
Also, I updated code in some files under `sensors`. The device had to be able to read data from sensors including temperature, accelometer and gyroscope.
